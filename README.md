# Introduction
This is the classic arcade Pong game from 1972 developed in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), allows to play locally with 2 players or against the machine.

You can play it on [itch.io](https://s3r0s4pi3ns.itch.io/retro-pong)

This game was made without any graphic asset, just drawing with the internal draw functions that Godot give us.
